Project Title :
Cybercrime Report Classification

Description :
This project aims to create a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that assists citizens in accurately filing cybercrime reports on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP). The model analyzes complaint descriptions and categorizes them by victim type, fraud type, and other parameters in real time, improving the accuracy and efficiency of cybercrime reporting. This enhanced reporting system will ultimately support law enforcement efforts to address cybercrimes more effectively.
Technologies Used :
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Transformers (Hugging Face)
Text Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model: BERT, DistilBERT (or other transformer-based models),LSTM
